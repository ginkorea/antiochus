You are only doing yourself a disservice by failing to learn and utilize all of Nmapâs features. It is the first go-to tool you will use in the scanning and enumeration stage of many assessments, setting the foundation for the rest of your pentest. Keep a copy of this Nmap cheat sheet to refer back to, and consider our Complete Nmap Ethical Hacking Course . It, and many other ethical hacking courses, are available in our VIP Memberâs Section. Frequently Asked Questions What is Nmap, and why is it used? Nmap is a free network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a network by analyzing responses to various packets and requests. What is the Nmap command used for? Penetration testers and network administrators will use Nmap to discover machines on a network and their open ports, running services, operating systems, and a wealth of other useful information. Is Nmap scanning legal? This depends on your jurisdiction. In many places, the answer is no, not without prior permission from the owner of the site or network. We recommend reading a more complete answer in our article, Is Port Scanning Legal ? What can we hack with Nmap? Nmap is a tool used for scanning and enumeration. Hackers and penetration testers use the information gathered to see what the available attack surface is. However, there are a great number of NSE scripts that can perform such actions as password brute forcing, checking for backup and configuration files, searching for remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities, and testing default credentials. How do I scan an IP with Nmap? A basic scan of a single IP address is as easy as: nmap <ip> This will return if the host is up and responding to ping, what ports are open, and what services are running on them. More complex commands can be found in the cheat sheet above. Is it OK to Nmap Google? The long answer is, it depends on your jurisdiction. The short answer is, probably not and you shouldnât do it. Even if it isnât illegal where you live, it will most certainly violate Googleâs terms of service. Do firewalls block Nmap? Firewalls can block access to ports, which would indeed block Nmap. Nmap does have flags to attempt to evade firewalls and intrusion detection systems, which we have listed in the cheat sheet above. Is Nmap a vulnerability? After you have installed Nmap on your host system, an over-ambitious antivirus program may flag it as malicious. So long as you have downloaded it from the official Nmap website , it is safe to have installed. Can Nmap bypass a firewall? Nmap has several optional services which can attempt to bypass firewalls and spoof its scans. See the Firewall / IDS Evasion and Spoofing section above for details. Can Nmap hack WiFi? Nmap has many NSE scripts designed to brute force different services and logins. Depending on the login portal, there may be a relevant script to do so. More realistically, Nmap would be used to enumerate the network, and one of many free programs better suited to WiFi hacking would be used afterward. Can Nmap crack passwords? Nmap has many brute force scripts which will automate password login attempts on various services, such as MySQL, Telenet, and POP3. This may provide a quick win, but password attacks are better handled by tools dedicated to that purpose, such as THC Hydra . How do I read Nmap results? Fortunately, even the more complex Nmap scans display their results in a clear and easy-to-follow manner. You also have the ability to output the data in various forms, including as an XML or grepable file (see the Output section for details). You can also see our Zenmap vs. Nmap article to learn about the graphical version of the tool. 2k SHARES LinkedIn X 2k Facebook Level Up in Cyber Security: Join Our Membership Today!

You are only doing yourself a disservice by failing to learn and utilize all of Nmapâs features. It is the first go-to tool you will use in the scanning and enumeration stage of many assessments, setting the foundation for the rest of your pentest. Keep a copy of this Nmap cheat sheet to refer back to, and consider our Complete Nmap Ethical Hacking Course . It, and many other ethical hacking courses, are available in our VIP Memberâs Section. Frequently Asked Questions What is Nmap, and why is it used? Nmap is a free network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a network by analyzing responses to various packets and requests. What is the Nmap command used for? Penetration testers and network administrators will use Nmap to discover machines on a network and their open ports, running services, operating systems, and a wealth of other useful information. Is Nmap scanning legal? This depends on your jurisdiction. In many places, the answer is no, not without prior permission from the owner of the site or network. We recommend reading a more complete answer in our article, Is Port Scanning Legal ? What can we hack with Nmap? Nmap is a tool used for scanning and enumeration. Hackers and penetration testers use the information gathered to see what the available attack surface is. However, there are a great number of NSE scripts that can perform such actions as password brute forcing, checking for backup and configuration files, searching for remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities, and testing default credentials. How do I scan an IP with Nmap? A basic scan of a single IP address is as easy as: nmap <ip> This will return if the host is up and responding to ping, what ports are open, and what services are running on them. More complex commands can be found in the cheat sheet above. Is it OK to Nmap Google? The long answer is, it depends on your jurisdiction. The short answer is, probably not and you shouldnât do it. Even if it isnât illegal where you live, it will most certainly violate Googleâs terms of service. Do firewalls block Nmap? Firewalls can block access to ports, which would indeed block Nmap. Nmap does have flags to attempt to evade firewalls and intrusion detection systems, which we have listed in the cheat sheet above. Is Nmap a vulnerability? After you have installed Nmap on your host system, an over-ambitious antivirus program may flag it as malicious. So long as you have downloaded it from the official Nmap website , it is safe to have installed. Can Nmap bypass a firewall? Nmap has several optional services which can attempt to bypass firewalls and spoof its scans. See the Firewall / IDS Evasion and Spoofing section above for details. Can Nmap hack WiFi? Nmap has many NSE scripts designed to brute force different services and logins. Depending on the login portal, there may be a relevant script to do so. More realistically, Nmap would be used to enumerate the network, and one of many free programs better suited to WiFi hacking would be used afterward. Can Nmap crack passwords? Nmap has many brute force scripts which will automate password login attempts on various services, such as MySQL, Telenet, and POP3. This may provide a quick win, but password attacks are better handled by tools dedicated to that purpose, such as THC Hydra . How do I read Nmap results? Fortunately, even the more complex Nmap scans display their results in a clear and easy-to-follow manner. You also have the ability to output the data in various forms, including as an XML or grepable file (see the Output section for details). You can also see our Zenmap vs. Nmap article to learn about the graphical version of the tool. 2k SHARES LinkedIn X 2k Facebook Level Up in Cyber Security: Join Our Membership Today!
